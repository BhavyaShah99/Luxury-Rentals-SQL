# Luxury-Rentals-SQL
For a Databases course during my junior year as an assignment, I along with an assignment partner built a database schema for the backend of a Luxury Property Rental service website.
# Running files :
1. Run the schema.ddl file in your database to define the database schema for the luxury rentals.
2. Query file 1-5 provide basic queries that could be run on this schema to retrieve different types of information about these rentals
